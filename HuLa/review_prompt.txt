Please review these code changes for quality, security, and best practices:

## Changes Made

### 1. MessageStrategy.ts - Added sanitizeFileName function
```typescript
const sanitizeFileName = (name: string): string => {
  return name
    .replace(/\s+/g, '_')
    .replace(/[<>:"/\\|?*]/g, '_')
}
```

### 2. MessageStrategy.ts - Applied sanitizeFileName to temp paths (4 places)
- temp-image paths now use sanitizeFileName(file.name)
- temp-file paths now use sanitizeFileName(validatedFile.name)
- temp-video paths now use sanitizeFileName(file.name)
- temp-thumbnail paths now use sanitizeFileName(thumbnailFile.name)

### 3. useUpload.ts - Updated safeFileName regex
Added .replace(/\s+/g, '_') to handle spaces

### 4. useUpload.ts - Updated generateHashKey function
Added filename sanitization for non-deduplication mode

## Problem Being Fixed
Images with filenames containing spaces (like '屏幕截图 2026-01-08 200257.png') were causing broken image display because the MinIO URL was malformed (spaces in URL cause 'Malformed URL' errors).

Please identify any issues, security concerns, or suggestions for improvement.
